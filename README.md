# Movies-Dataset
Using the Movies Dataset I cleaned and removed missing values in the dataset as I wanted to make my dataset consistent and cleaner ready for me to create visuals. I also explored different libraries with RStudio including ggplot to create these different charts such as outliers in a box plot, histogram, scatter graph, and bar chart as shown in the document.
